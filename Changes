    Unrecognized arguments to new() raise an exception

    Add new() argument 'uses'. Modules specified with 'uses' are
    presumed by all_prereqs_used() to have been used, even if no use of
    them was found.

    Delete eg/prereq.t. Instead, refer to t/prereq.t

    Add method all_prereqs_used() which gets called after all code
    prerequisites have been analyzed.

    Diagnostic if 'accept' entry is prerequisite.

    Add --accepts option to eg/test-prereq-meta

    Base provided modules on .pm files in MANIFEST because
    Module::Metadata->provides() strains out private modules. This is
    the correct behavior for CPAN indexing, but if private modules are
    in fact used, this module needs to know that they are provided. This
    means I no longer need to grovel though the no_index metadata.

    Pick up modules from the no_index metadata, since presumably they
    come with the distro and therefore do not need to be declared as
    dependencies.

    Add new() argument 'file_error'. This is a test name template to be
    used if Module::Extract::Use failed to process the given file.

    Require Module::Extract::Use 1.045 because in that version
    get_modules_with_details() returns an array reference even if no
    'use' or 'require' statements were found.
