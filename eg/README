README
    This file

test-prereq-meta
    Tests a distribution against its prerequisites. It is command-line
    driven, and can be run from anywhere provided you tell it where the
    files are. If run from a distributon directory it needs no input.
    The heavy lifting is done by the all_prereq_ok() method.

You may also want to look at (or copy) t/prereq.t.
